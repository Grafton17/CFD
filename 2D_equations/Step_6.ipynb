    "\n",
    "From now on we use a different method for the evaluation of $u\\left(x,\\; y,\\; t\\right)$ across all the mesh. \n",
    "\n",
    "Until now we've used nested for-loops, which fastly become computationally heavy (i.e. the simulation runs really slow). Instead of using this ineffective strategy, we resort to the optimization already done by computer geeks and we start to use Numpy-array's operations. Especially, we are going to use the slicing of arrays in order to evaluate faster the values of $u\\left(x,\\; y,\\; \\hat t + 1\\right)$ for every $\\left(x,\\; y\\right)$, given the values of $u\\left(x,\\; y,\\; \\hat t\\right)$. \n",

    "To evaluate the computation time of my simulations, I use cell's magic functions named '$\\textit{time}$' and '$\\textit{timeit}$', which are called using the double $\\textbf{\\%}$. They're different from Python built-in functions, for further readings consult:\n",
