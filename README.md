# CFD
This is where I put all things that I learn on CFD.

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of what I learn and of tips and tricks about doing simulations with Python. It is $\textbf{NOT}$ absolutely intended to replicate a fully exhaustive universitary course about CFD. As already mentioned in my Grafton17/Grafton17's README.md document, my goal is to simulate plasma physics phenomena and I am going to be meticulous when it is time. For now, this repository is just a logbook of my CFD's notebooks with which I learn how to use GitHub.

# Summary

- Step 1: 1D-linear convection equation
- Step 2: Nonlinear convection and 'upwind scheme'
- Step 3: Convergence and the CFL condition
- Step 4: Diffusion equation in 1-D + animation
- Step 5: Burgers' equation in 1-D
- Step 6: [Speeding up simulations](2D_equations/Step_6.ipynb)
- Step 7: [2-D Linear Advection](2D_equations/Step_7.ipynb)
- Step 8: [2-D Advection](2D_equations/Step_8.ipynb)
- Step 9: [2-D diffusion + animation](2D_equations/Step_9.ipynb)

# Acknowledgements

Most of the code is based upon the great lectures given by Prof. Lorena Barba of the George Washington University, which can be found here: https://piazza.com/bu/spring2013/me702/info (also watch this https://doi.org/10.21105/jose.00021).

I also need to mention the awesome reworking of the above cited course by Prof. Zhengtao Gan of Arizona University (see here: https://drzgan.github.io/Python_CFD/intro.html).

I'm very grateful to them and to their online notes, videos and notebooks on CFD. Without these it wouldn't have been such an easy task learning a little bit of CFD. 

I also need to thank the vast and rich internet world. I used a lot of web's stuff as a support for my learning, and if someone is not okay with the hyperlinks that I put all over my notebooks, just email me and I'll remove them!

Fly safe!
